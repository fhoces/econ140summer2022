 This course provides an introduction to statistical and estimation analysis of economic data, also known as “Econometrics”. It covers topics such as the linear regression model and its estimator, Ordinary Least Squares, as well as extensions such as Instrumental Variables models, panel data models, and time series models. Topics covered in this course are similar to those in 141.

13.5 hours of outside work hours per week, 3 hours of the exchange of opinions or questions on course material per week, and 6 hours of instructor presentation of course materials per week.
